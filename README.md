# A-Location-Based-Service-Android-app-on-BaaS
The motivation for every location based information system is:
To assist with the exact information, at right place in real time with
personalized setup and location sensitiveness‚Äù.

Such needs can only be catered with the help of LBS. But these applications
are limited to desktops only. In this era we dealing with smartphones, which
are going to replace the bulky desktops even for are computational purposes.
We need to import them on mobile devices All the information must be
available in his mobile device and also in user customized format.

A location-based service (LBS) is a mobile application that is dependent on
the location of a mobile device. A positioning component is usually needed in
a LBS application to determine the location of user's mobile device. Most of
the current LBS services do not require users to input location manually, like
giving zip code or street name.

This project will go through the development of a prototype application, based
on the mobile operating system Android, implementing a LBS, with the help
of GPS, social and cloud technologies.
Protocols like Facebook Open graph has been used in order to improve
engagement on social network, get data for user profiling, and provide custom
targeted content.

BaaS cloud model has been used to support common back-end services,
offering capabilities like social media integration, hosting, notifications,
database creation and event tracking. Those features, along with the
automation of scalability and RESTful API generation in the cloud, boost
developement allowing to focus on other aspect of the application such as UX.

The Parse cloud application platform supports iOS, Android, JavaScript,
Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, and OS X platforms. Parse provides scalable
backend solutions, push notications, social integration, data storage, and
custom logic possibility, maintains and scales backend infrastructure including
push notifications, database management and mobile analytics.

This approach increases both the efficiency of mobile application development
and the quality of the resulting software artifacts.
This is achieved by providing a mobile, platform-independent, highabstraction
level environment for mobile application design.
